  event: Ludum Dare 35
  date: April 2016
  details: |
    A quick, but polished game created in Unity for the theme 'Shapeshift'. The gist of the game is that you play as a shapeshifting
    polygon that has been assigned the duty to protect the Mathematica Arcana from the shapeless blobs that want to steal it. We got some
    really good feedback and our best scores to date on this game with the simple mechanics

    Bitmite Blitz started out life as a game jam game made in less than 72 hours for the theme 'Beneath the Surface'.
    What we ended up with was a basic, but very polished game. Fellow jammers provided some excellent feedback, including
    "Really good stuff! Amazing polish for the allotted time." and "I keep coming back to this game to try to beat my score.".

    Expanding on the work done for Ravenous Ravenous Raptors, we added achievements and an interactive tutorial to the game-- Rarely
    seen features in game jams. You can see the original jam entry

  event: Bacon Game Jam 7
  date: April 2014
  details: |
    Coin Flip Games participated for the second time in the Bacon Game Jam. Given the theme 'Hunger' we came up with a unique game idea.
    The result can be best described as "Reverse Hungry Hungry Hippos... with raptors". During this jam, we also added a global scoreboard
    API using PHP, MySQL and HMAC message passing.

  event: Global Game Jam 2014
  date: January 2014
  details: |
    Coin Flip Games travelled to Denver to participate in the largest Global Game Jam ever. We created a game based on the theme
    "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." We took that to a very literal direction and made a fast-paced, arcardey
    style game about an insane asylum patient with delusions of being an elevator. I spent the first half of the jam creating the art assets.
    The remainder was spent implementing the elevator mechanic primarily.

    A game made with the rest of the Coin Flip Games team, in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 28. The game is a simply restaurant management game
    where you only get one day to prove that you have what it takes to run this cafe. My contribution to this game was primarily creating
    art assets, adding effects, designing the UI and creating the game ambience.

  event: The Walking Dead Game Jam
  date: October 2013
  details: |
    A Top Down Hack-n-Slash game made with my team for the Walking Dead Game Jam. It was our first time creating a game together using 3D assets.
     We only had 2 weeks to put together a game in our spare time, but we managed to get our endless survival game to be fun and addictive; with
     graphical nostalgia of the N64 era.

  event: The Arbitrary Game Jam
  date: Sep 2013
  details: |
    A game made in about 8 hours using Löve. It's a simple game designed to feel somewhat hectic since the pressure of creating a game in such a
    short period of time has that effect. View the code and read more about the project on <a href="https://github.com/rnewton/tag" target="_blank">Github</a>

    My First entry into the 48-hour Game Creation Competition, Ludum Dare. Also my second complete game using Unity 3D. The theme was "10 seconds" and I came
    up with a game that I would call the "Hollywood Hacking Simulator". The game features a command line interface used to send malicious packets and other
    attacks against your opponents, online via random match making or offline against a bot. I used blender to create some 3D models, Photoshop for all the
    texturing and C# for the scripting.

  event: iamagamer Jam
  date: July 2013
  details: |
    My first Game Jam and also my first use of Unity 3D. I created this game for the iamagamer inaugural game jam. The theme was "Women in Gaming" to refute
    the claim that women can't have the lead role in video games. I quickly threw together a simple enough mechanic and learned Unity as I went in this 48-hour
    competition.

    This is the original Snaaake! Written in 3 days using Löve. It is essentially the prototype for Top Snake. This version is missing a few features of the
    second version, but does have a more arcade feel and is open source. Check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/rnewton/Snaaake" target="_blank">Github</a>
