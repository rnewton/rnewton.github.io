    - name: American Journal Experts Backend
      details: |
        The AJE backend is a large, monolithic beast of an application with portions of the code dating back to the mid-2000s.
        Everything that the company needed for supporting customers, employees and contractors was placed into the application.
        By the time I joined, there was already a large effort underway to correct this and pull out bits of the application into
        microservices. I've been part of the effort to support this application in the transition to microservices as well as
        contribute to pulling out pieces and refactoring. It's a massive effort and it is paying off.

    - name: American Journal Experts Localized Sites
      details: |
        Research Square customers live around the world and speak a variety of languages. In order to offer services to these
        markets, we setup a series of microsites in Jekyll that are catered to customers in that region. The sites are similar,
        but differ in language and certain content so we have to use internationalization and some build tricks to create multiple
        sites from a shared code-base.

  projects:
    - name: Medical Complication Analysis
      details: |
        I was the lead developer on a project to collect, aggregate and perform statistical analysis on Medical Complications. I added
        onto an existing web application the ability to process these complications for large sets of patient data (sometimes up to 20
        million rows). This data was then queried and displayed for use by Hospital and Health System Administration to determine problems.
        For this project, I was required to design the overall structure of the report, create extendable models and write efficient MySQL
        queries through our existing PHP MVC Framework.

    - name: Person-Based Health Record Analysis
      details: |
        I was the lead developer on this project to replace an existing code base used to report Patient Data across Hospital visits.
        The new system was able to process the patient data and report it in a clean, searchable interface. My responsibilities included
        design of new data structures, the overall architecture and import/export process, customer training and implementation.

    - name: Medical Marketing System
      details: |
        I was the sole designer, developer and owner of this project. I was tasked with updating the existing marketing and meta-data
        system for Hospital and Health Systems. I met with managers to determine the requirements, determined the best practices and tools
        to use, designed the database structure and corresponding models, designed and created the user interfaces and front-end.
        Additionally, I created an internal wrapper for the Fedex Shipping and Tracking API using PHP SOAP with wsdl requests. During the project,
        I worked with the testers to come up with a test plan and created a schedule for internal release.

  projects:
    - name: Performance Benchmarking
      details: |
        I worked on a team with other interns to build prototype and released HP workstation computers to specifications and perform a variety of
        benchmarks on them. The benchmarks tested things like CPU, Graphics and memory performance for internal review as well as data for
        marketing materials. We participated in the <a href="http://spec.org/">SPEC</a> organization benchmarks as well as others for specific
        clients such as the military. Internal benchmarking required building workstations using prototype components in order to assess their
        capabilities and often to troubleshoot issues that could occur.

      details: |
        I was the sole designer, developer and owner of this project. I created a web application to track Workstation computers and components
        for internal and external use. The entire system was able to track a computer and all the components locations over time and provide decision
        support on allocation. I was able to provide an initial release after just three months and then keep up with a two week release cycle for updates.

    - name: Multi-threaded Benchmark
      details: |
        My primary role at Hewlett Packard was to do performance benchmarking of workstations. There was a gap in tests for Multi-threaded
        Benchmarks that only tested the CPU and only took a short period of time to run (SPEC CPU ran over a period of 3 days on average). A co-worker and
        I created a simple, internal use benchmark to test CPU integer and floating point performance on many threads. The prototype was written in Java and
        then ported to C++ for better performance.
