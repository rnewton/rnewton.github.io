    To aid in the development of future LÃ¶ve games, I created a simple entity framework called 'emma'. Games benefit greatly
    from the Entity/Component design pattern over a standard inheritance model. Code reuse is ensured through the use of mixins,
    or components. Emma allows object organization through tags. Check out the source on

    I placed my <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts">Quantopian</a> algorithm for a lazy portfolio on
    <a href="https://github.com/rnewton/quantopian">Github.</a> The strategy is to just take a few ETFs and maintain a percentage
    balance checked on a daily basis. I replaced some more broad ETFs with more targeted ones in the green energy sector.
